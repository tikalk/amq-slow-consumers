amq slow consumers sample app


this demo is aimed at solving slow consumers with activemq.
and how to monitor activemq with jmx.


The server starts an ActiveMQ broker.
It has a notifier service that sends a notification to a notification.topic
every some interval.


The producer simply runs in a loop and send a message to a queue 'source.queue'
every some interval.
it has a notification listener that listens for notification on the notification.topic.


The consumer listens to the 'source.queue' and prints the arriving messages.
it also has a notification listener.
