to configure DLQ:



Known bugs:
for AMQ 5.3, if using loggingBrokerPlugin DLQ will not work,messages will not be sent to DLQ.
see: http://old.nabble.com/LoggingBrokerPlugin-and-DLQ-td27588791.html
for AMQ 5.3, if authorization is configured for queues then the broker will not be able to
send messages to DLQ,
see:https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2516
in AMQ 5.2, expired messages are not moved from the queue,
see:http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1796
although it should be fixed in 5.2 it still doesn't work.



configuration for 5.3, currently works only if there is no authorization for queues.

if no DeadLetterStrategy is configured the default is sharedDeadLetterStrategy.

you can configure DeadLetterStrategy in the policy map.

make sure users have permissions to the the DLQ.


how its implemented in this sample:
the producer is configured with a timeToLive property, see the jmsTemplate
injected to the producer, default is 0, messages do not expire.
and configured deadLetterStrategy for activemq with processExpired="true"
