monitoring activemq


JMX monitoring:
first thing is to enable JMX by setting useJmx="true" in the broker configuration.
or add that to the broker url as ?useJmx=true

use <managementContext> to configure JMX in amq
see this:
http://activemq.apache.org/jmx.html#JMX-ManagementContextPropertiesReference

add connectorPort="2011" to add a JMX connector.
and when starting the server look for the message:
"JMX consoles can connect to service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:2011/jmxrmi"


the property java.rmi.server.hostname tell the RMI the host name to
bind to, so setting that to localhost will restrict access from localhost only.
